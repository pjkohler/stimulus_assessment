# stimulus_assessment

This is a repository of functions for assessing stimulus images used in oddball experiments and other experiments. 

Requires Kendrick Kay's SOC model, which can be downloaded from here: 
  http://kendrickkay.net/socmodel/

and John D'Errico's minimum bound suite, which can be downloaded from here: 
  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34767-a-suite-of-minimal-bounding-objects
  
Both should be placed on the path before running.
