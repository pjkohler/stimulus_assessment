# stimulus_assessment

This is a repository of functions for assessing stimulus images used in oddball experiments and other experiments. 

Requires Kendrick Kay's SOC model, which can be downloaded from here:

and John D'Errico's minimum bound suite, which can be downloaded from here:

Both should be placed on the path before running.
